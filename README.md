# **Ed Goold's tic-tac-toe Tech Test**

### **Introduction**

This is my response to the tic-tac-toe tech test from week 9 of the Dec 2017 Makers Academy course.

The aim is to create an application that allows two participants to play a game of tic-tac-toe until either a win or a draw is decided.

---

### **Installation**

The application requires the following the dependencies:

 -- Ruby 2.4.1 
 -- Datamapper
 -- Rspec

Following download, please install by running the following from the command line:

```
 $ bundle install
```

### **Rules of the Game**

The players decide which will play with an X and which with an O.

A square grid is then created, by default separated into 3 rows of 3 squares - i.e. 9 squares in total.

The players take turns to fill in a square with their symbol until either (a) 3 symbols in a i) horizontal, ii) vertical or iii) diagonal row are completed, resulting in a win for the player represented by that 3-in-a-row or (b) all squares in the grid are filled without a 3-in-a-row result therefore concluding in a draw.
